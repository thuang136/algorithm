Description
The French author Georges Perec (1936-1982) once wrote a book, La disparition, without the letter 'e'.

He was a member of the Oulipo group. A quote from the book:
Tout avait Pair normal, mais tout s'affirmait faux. Tout avait Fair normal, d'abord, puis surgissait l'inhumain, 
l'affolant. Il aurait voulu savoir o¨´ s'articulait l'association qui l'unissait au roman : 
stir son tapis, assaillant ¨¤ tout instant son imagination, l'intuition d'un tabou, 
a vision d'un mal obscur, d'un quoi vacant, d'un non-dit : la vision, l'avision d'un oubli commandant tout, 
o¨´ s'abolissait la raison : tout avait l'air normal mais¡­

Perec would probably have scored high (or rather, low) in the following contest. 
People are asked to write a perhaps even meaningful text on some subject with as few occurrences of a given "word" as possible. 
Our task is to provide the jury with a program that counts these occurrences, 
in order to obtain a ranking of the competitors. 
These competitors often write very long texts with nonsense meaning; 
a sequence of 500,000 consecutive 'T's is not unusual. And they never use spaces.
So we want to quickly find out how often a word, i.e., a given string, occurs in a text. 
More formally: given the alphabet {'A', 'B', 'C', ¡­, 'Z'} and two finite strings over that alphabet, 
a word W and a text T, count the number of occurrences of W in T. 
All the consecutive characters of W must exactly match consecutive characters of T. Occurrences may overlap.

Input
The first line of the input file contains a single number: the number of test cases to follow. Each test case has the following format:
"    One line with the word W, a string over {'A', 'B', 'C', ¡­, 'Z'}, with 1 ¡Ü |W| ¡Ü 10,000 (here |W| denotes the length of the string W). 
"    One line with the text T, a string over {'A', 'B', 'C', ¡­, 'Z'}, with |W| ¡Ü |T| ¡Ü 1,000,000.
Output
For every test case in the input file, the output should contain a single number, 
on a single line: the number of occurrences of the word W in the text T.
