/*

the flyweight pattern's effectiveness depend heavily on how and where it's used. Apply the flyweight pattern when all of the following are true:

1. An application uses a large numberof objects
2. storage costs are high because of the sheer quantity of objects
3. most object state can be made extrinsic
4. many groups of objects may be replaced by relatively few shared objects once extrinsic state is removed
