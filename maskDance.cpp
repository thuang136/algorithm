A mask dance club in our company has decided to show Bongsan mask dance.

It has many characters and two of them wear tiger masks.

The sizes of the masks are related to the sum of hips¡¯ sizes of the dancers,

i.e. to wear the masks for two people, the sum of their hips¡¯ sizes should be the same or less than the sizes of the masks.
If you know all sizes of each club member hips, create a program that calculates the combination number of members that can wear the given tiger masks.

Time limit: 5 second (java: 10 seconds)

[Input]
Several test cases can be included in the inputs. T, the number of cases is given in the first row of the inputs. After that, the test cases as many as T (T ¡Ü 30) are given in a row.
The number of club members, N and the sizes of tiger masks are given on the first row per each test case. (2 ¡Ü N ¡Ü 1,000,000, 1 ¡Ü S ¡Ü 10,000,000)
The all sizes of each member hips, S are given from the second row to N number rows. (1 ¡Ü H ¡Ü 10,000,000)

[Output]
Output the combination number of members that can wear the given tiger masks on the first row per each test case.
