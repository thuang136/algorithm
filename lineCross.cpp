/*

line cross

In given coordinates of three lines, A, B and C, create a program that finds out whether these lines are connected or not. 

Let¡¯s suppose the lines are crossed when two lines are touched or crossed each other.

Time limit: 1 second (java: 2 seconds)

[Input]
Several test cases can be included in the inputs. T, the number of cases is given in the first row of the inputs. After that, the test cases as many as T (T ¡Ü 30) are given in a row.
The starting points (x1, y1) & arriving points (x2, y2) of the line A are given on the first row per each test case.
The starting points (x1, y1) & arriving points (x2, y2) of the line B are given on the second row.
The starting points (x1, y1) & arriving points (x2, y2) of the line C are given on the third row.

[Output]
Output one of X, AB or BC depending on whether lines are connected or not on the first row of each test case.
